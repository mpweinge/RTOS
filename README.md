This is a real time operating system created in C for MTE 241 (Real-Time Operating Systems) at the University of Waterloo, dept. Electrical and Computer Engineering.

The project aims to simulate an operating system (in actuality it runs on top of the linux kernel within a linux os). To simulate the operating system it responds to simulated hardware interrupts in a timely fashion, and performs context switching with a priority-based scheduler using the setjmp and longjmp linux utilities. 

It received notoriety as being the first project to control the terminal window using the curses library in C. A perfect mark was acheived on the project.
